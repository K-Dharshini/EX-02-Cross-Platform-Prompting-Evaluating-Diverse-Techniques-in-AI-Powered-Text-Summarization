# Ex-2 Cross Platform Prompting Evaluating Diverse Techniques in AI Powered Text Summarization

## Aim:
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

## Scenario:
You are part of a content curation team for an educational platform that delivers quick summaries of research papers to undergraduate students.  
Your task is to summarize a 500-word technical article on **"The Basics of Blockchain Technology"** using multiple AI platforms and prompting strategies.

The goal is to determine which **combination of prompting technique + platform** provides the best summary in terms of:

1. Accuracy  
2. Coherence  
3. Simplicity  
4. Speed  
5. User experience

## Algorithm:
### Step 1: Choose a technical article (500 words) on Blockchain.  
### Step 2: Apply multiple prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, role-based, chain-of-thought).  
### Step 3: Use different platforms (ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude).  
### Step 4: Collect and compare the summaries generated.  
### Step 5: Evaluate the results using five parameters:  
```
   - Accuracy  
   - Coherence  
   - Simplicity  
   - Speed  
   - User Experience
``` 
### Step 6: Identify the most effective combination.   

## Output:
### What Is Blockchain?
Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. Unlike traditional databases, it stores data in blocks that are linked chronologically to form a chain. Once data is recorded, it’s nearly impossible to alter without consensus from the network, making it highly secure and transparent.

### Core Components
- **Blocks**: Each block contains a batch of transactions, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block.  
- **Nodes**: Independent computers that maintain and validate the blockchain.  
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Protocols like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) ensure agreement across nodes before adding new blocks.  

### Key Features
- **Immutability**: Once data is added, it cannot be changed.  
- **Transparency**: All participants can view the ledger.  
- **Security**: Cryptographic techniques protect data integrity.  
- **Decentralization**: No single authority controls the system.  

### How It Works
1. A transaction is initiated.  
2. It’s broadcast to the network of nodes.  
3. Nodes validate the transaction using a consensus algorithm.  
4. Once verified, the transaction is grouped into a block.  
5. The block is added to the chain, creating a permanent record.  

### Applications
- Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum  
- Smart Contracts that execute automatically when conditions are met  
- Supply Chain Management for tracking goods  
- Healthcare for secure patient records  
- Voting Systems to ensure transparency and prevent fraud  

### Why It Matters
Blockchain offers a trustless system where participants don’t need to rely on intermediaries. It’s revolutionizing industries by enhancing efficiency, security, and accountability.

## Result:
After comparing outputs, **Copilot with a zero-shot structured prompting style produced the best summary**.  

- **Accuracy**: Covered all major aspects (definition, components, features, workflow, applications).  
- **Coherence**: Clear structure with headings and logical flow.  
- **Simplicity**: Beginner-friendly, avoids overly technical jargon.  
- **Speed**: Easy to skim using sectioned format and bullet points.  
- **User Experience**: Use of emojis, headings, and step-by-step lists makes it engaging and accessible.  

Therefore, **Copilot outperformed other platforms** in this task, especially for undergraduate learners who prefer clarity, speed, and readability.
